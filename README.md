# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
​​To write maintainable, readable, and adaptable​ programs, it is essential to follow best practices such as clear and consistent naming conventions, modular design, and documentation. In my work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, I implemented these principles making it easy to connect the dashboard widgets to the ​database in Project Two. This​ simplifies maintenance, ease of updates, and scalability. In the future, this ​CRUD Python module can be adapted​ for various applications requiring database interactions, saving time and ensuring consistency across different projects.
# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
​​As a computer scientist, I approach​ problems ​by breaking​ them down ​into manageable​ components to address each part. ​For the database and dashboard requirements​ of ​Grazioso Salvare, I​ started by understanding the specific needs and then designed the CRUD module to meet those requirements efficiently. This project required a more integrated approach compared to previous assignments because it involved backend database operations and frontend data visualization. In future projects, I would continue to use modular design and documentation to ensure that databases can be adapted to changing needs.
# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
Computer scientists design and ​develop software​ solutions that solve complex problems and improve efficiency. ​My work on this project helps Grazioso Salvare​ by providing a system for managing and visualizing animal data, improving their rescue operations and decision-making processes. The ability to transform technical skills into practical solutions is an aspect of why computer science is vital these days.
